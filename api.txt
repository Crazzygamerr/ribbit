Our Data
Patent Portfolio
NASA Technology Transfer APIThe NASA patent portfolio is available to benefit US citizens. Through partnerships and licensing agreements with industry, these patents ensure that NASA investments in pioneering research find secondary uses that benefit the economy, create jobs, and improve quality of life. Our patent portfolio contains over 1400 technologies currently available for licensing.

Software Catalog
NASA Technology Transfer APIOffering an extensive portfolio of software products for a wide variety of technical applications, the NASA Software Catalog is organized into fifteen broad subject matter categories. All catalog entries include the software title, the product ID number (known internally as the NASA case number), a short description, and the software's specified release type. Some software descriptions contain links to additional information or downloading options.

Spinoff
NASA Technology Transfer APINASA's Spinoff publication accomplishes several goals. First, it is a convincing justification for the continued expenditure of NASA funds. It serves as a tool to educate the media and the general public by informing them about the benefits and dispelling the myth of wasted taxpayer dollars. It reinforces interest in space exploration. It demonstrates the possibility to apply aerospace technology in different environments. It highlights the ingenuity of American inventors, entrepreneurs, and application engineers, and the willingness of a government agency to assist them. And finally, it continues to ensure global competitiveness and technological leadership by the United States.
